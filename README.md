# Project Summary

In this project, we'll provide practice JavaScript problems to help you better understand the fundamentals.

## Setup

* `Fork` this repository.
* `Clone` your fork.
* Open `./practice.js` with your code editor.
* Open `./index.html` with your browser.

## Directions

Complete all the activities inside of `./practice.js` to make the spec runner pass it's tests. In order to check the progress of the spec runner, open `./SpecRunner.html` with your browser. Remember to commit and push your code often. Good luck!

## Tips and Tricks

One of the biggest tools at the developer's disposal is the browser's built-in debugger. To use it, open `./index.html` with your browser. Another great tool for small and isolated pieces of code is <a href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#">Python Tutor</a>. Just make sure to change the code to `JavaScript ES6`.

car.miles = 100;

// adding or updating properties with bracket notation
// if miles already exists on the object, this would change it's value
// if it doesn't this will set it as a key with a value of 150
car['miles'] = 150

// if a property doesn't exist on an object, it's considered undefined

car.owner === undefined // true

// Function Parameters, Arguments and Invoking (calling) a Function
// name is a function parameter
// a variable we'll use in our function body

function sayMyName(name) {

// the string 'Your name is Jeff' will be output
// from this function because of the return keyword

  return 'Your name is ' + name;
}

// function invocation
// parentheses after the function tell the function to run
// The string Jeff is called an argument (a value passed to a function and received as a parameter)
sayMyName('Jeff');

// Here we're passing more arguments than there are parameters
// Only Jeff will be received as "name" in the parameter list
sayMyName('Jeff', 'Karen')
